I will use useEffect and useState to render and store data respectively. Then, I will create a function which will make a get request to get the data from an API. For that i will use `axios`. Also, within the API i will use `${currency}` in order to let the user chose what currency they will be paying with. Then, I will also use parameters to implement the search functionality, change limit -> (how many items will be displayed at a time) and be able to use offset -> (load the next set of matching data after search was completed). On page load I will let the user chose the currency straight away before any api requests are made. Once they have chosen, I will remove that screen with short circuiting and display the search bar where they will be able to search for something, and return will be in their chosen currency. To use offset parameter i will have a button and to change limit, I will have `<option>` inside `<select>` element.


If I was asked to make improvements. I would split the code in separate components which would make the code more readable, easier to use and scalable for bigger projects. Also I could include some attributes for people with disabilities, e.g "aria-controls" and "role" to inform assistive technologies how an element should be used.
