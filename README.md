I plan to use the useEffect and useState hooks to render and store data, respectively. Additionally, I will create a function that will make a GET request to retrieve data from an API using axios. I will also use the ${currency} parameter to allow users to choose their preferred currency. To implement the search functionality, I will use parameters such as limit (to control the number of items displayed at a time) and offset (to load the next set of matching data after the search has been completed). Upon page load, users will be prompted to choose their preferred currency before any API requests are made. Once they have selected their currency, I will remove the selection screen and display the search bar where users can search for items, with results displayed in their chosen currency. To use the offset parameter, a button will be provided, and to change the limit, users can select from options within a select element.
